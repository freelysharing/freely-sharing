## Kiwix -- Offline Wikipeida
kiwix is a good project for sharing **Knowledge on Wikipedia**. There is a simple way to get offline Wikipedia available, roughly two steps:
1. download a zim file archive, **wikipedia_en_physics_novid_2019-05.zim** for physics. (zim is similar to .zip file archive)
2. install a kiwix reader. If you are using Windows 10, install **Kiwix JS** from Microsoft Store. There are also browsre plugins which enable you to use your browser like Firefox to read wikis inside a zim file archive. (after installing, select the zim file downloaded in the setting.)
